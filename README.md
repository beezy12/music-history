# music-history

The biggest project of our front-end semester. Everything we learned was applied here.

A music data app, where a user can browse a list of collected songs, and can filter the list either by using the select dropdowns or by typing in the search bar. Song information is stored in the Firebase database.

Clicking on a song will show song and artist details for that particular song.
Clicking the delete button next to a song will remove it from the user's list.

Users can add a new song by selecting the 'add music' tab, and then filling in song and artist info on that page.
